      <description>Introduction We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.
In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the &amp;ldquo;$&amp;rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with &amp;ldquo;#&amp;rdquo; are comments that I&amp;rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the &amp;ldquo;:wq&amp;rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
